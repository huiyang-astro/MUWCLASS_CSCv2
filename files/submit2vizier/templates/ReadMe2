Abstract:
    With the advent of very large X-ray surveys, an automated
    classification of X-ray sources becomes increasingly valuable. This
    work proposes a revisited naive Bayes classification of the X-ray
    sources in the Swift-XRT and XMM- Newton catalogs into four classes -
    AGN, stars, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and cataclysmic variables (CVs) -
    based on their spatial, spectral, and timing properties and their
    multiwavelength counterparts. An outlier measure is used to identify
    objects of other natures. The classifier is optimized to maximize the
    classification performance of a chosen class (here XRBs), and it is
    adapted to data mining purposes. We augmented the X-ray catalogs with
    multiwavelength data, source class, and variability properties. We
    then built a reference sample of about 25000 X-ray sources of known
    nature. From this sample, the distribution of each property was
    carefully estimated and taken as reference to assign probabilities of
    belonging to each class. The classification was then performed on the
    whole catalog, combining the information from each property. Using the
    algorithm on the Swift reference sample, we retrieved 99%, 98%, 92%,
    and 34% of AGN, stars, XRBs, and CVs, respectively, and the false
    positive rates are 3%, 1%, 9%, and 15%. Similar results are obtained
    on XMM sources. When applied to a carefully selected test sample,
    representing 55% of the X-ray catalog, the classification gives
    consistent results in terms of distributions of source properties. A
    substantial fraction of sources not belonging to any class is
    efficiently retrieved using the outlier measure, as well as AGN and
    stars with properties deviating from the bulk of their class. Our
    algorithm is then compared to a random forest method; the two showed
    similar performances, but the algorithm presented in this paper
    improved insight into the grounds of each classification. This robust
    classification method can be tailored to include additional or
    different source classes and can be applied to other X-ray catalogs.
    The transparency of the classification compared to other methods makes
    it a useful tool in the search for homogeneous populations or rare
    source types, including multi-messenger events. Such a tool will be
    increasingly valuable with the development of surveys of unprecedented
    size, such as LSST, SKA, and Athena, and the search for counterparts
    of multi-messenger events.

Description:
    The following tables represent 72% and 84% of the Swift and XMM-Newton
    catalogs, respectively, taken as input of the classifier. They contain
    all information used in the classification, as well as the output
    results.
